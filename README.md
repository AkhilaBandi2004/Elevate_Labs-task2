# Python Command-Line To-Do List

A simple, yet effective command-line to-do list application built with Python. This script allows you to manage your tasks directly from the terminal. It's lightweight, fast, and saves your tasks to a local file, so you never lose track of what you need to do.

## üåü Features

* **View Tasks**: Display all your current tasks in a clean, numbered list.
* **Add Tasks**: Quickly add new tasks to your list.
* **Remove Tasks**: Easily remove completed or unwanted tasks by their number.
* **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are automatically saved to a `tasks.txt` file and reloaded every time you start the application.
* **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple menu-driven interface makes it easy to navigate and use.
* **Error Handling**: Includes basic error handling for file operations and user input to ensure a smooth experience.

## üöÄ How to Run

1.  **Save the Code**: Save the provided Python code as a file, for example, `todo.py`.
2.  **Open a Terminal**: Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
3.  **Run the Script**: Execute the script using the following command:
    ```sh
    python todo.py
    ```
4.  **Follow the Menu**: Once running, you will see a menu with options to view, add, or remove tasks. Enter the corresponding number to perform an action.

## üìÇ File Structure

The application creates and interacts with a single file:

* `tasks.txt`: This file is automatically generated in the same directory as the script. It stores all your tasks, with each task on a new line. You can safely edit this file manually, but the application handles all the reading and writing for you.

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Overview

The script is organized into several functions, each with a specific responsibility:

* `load_tasks()`: Checks if `tasks.txt` exists. If it does, it reads the tasks from the file into a list. If not, it returns an empty list.
* `save_tasks(tasks)`: Writes the current list of tasks back to `tasks.txt`, overwriting the previous content. This ensures the file is always up-to-date.
* `view_tasks(tasks)`: Prints a formatted view of the to-do list. If the list is empty, it displays a message.
* `add_task(tasks)`: Prompts the user to enter a new task description, adds it to the list, and saves the updated list.
* `remove_task(tasks)`: Shows the current tasks and asks the user for the number of the task to remove. It handles invalid input gracefully.
* `show_menu()`: Displays the main menu of options to the user.
* `main()`: The primary function that runs the application loop. It loads tasks, shows the menu, and calls the appropriate function based on user input.

This project is a great example of basic file I/O, user input handling, and modular function design in Python.
